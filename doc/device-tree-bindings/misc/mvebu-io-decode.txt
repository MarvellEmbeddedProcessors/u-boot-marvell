Marvell IO address decoding bindings
=====================================

The IO Decode node includes a description of the address decoding configuration.

The I/O decode node requires the following properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible: Should be "marvell,mvebu-io-decode".
	- unit_io_decode_info: The IO unit information which should map their
	decode window to DRAM.
		- reg_base: Base address of this I/O unit decode window.
		- range: Range of this I/O unit decode window in unit of byte.
		- IO_ATTR: Describles the I/O attributes
			- max_win: The unit's decode window number.
			- max_remap: The decode window number including this unit's remapping.
			- remap_size: Remap window size in unit of bits, normally should be 32 or
			64.
			- win_offset: The offset between the continuous decode windows with the
			same unit, typically it is 0x10.

Example:
	io-decode {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-io-decode";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		unit_io_decode_info =
			/* reg_base, range, IO_ATTR(max_win, max_remap, remap_size, win_offset) */
			<0xcb00 0x30 IO_ATTR(3, 0, 32, 0x10) /* eMMC */
			0xc800 0x30 IO_ATTR(3, 0, 32, 0x10)> /* SATA */;
	};
