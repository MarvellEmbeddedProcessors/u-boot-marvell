Marvell IOB address decoding bindings
=====================================

The IOB node include describtion about the address decoding configuration.

IOB supports up to n (in CP110 n=24) windows for external memory transaction.
When a transaction passes through the IOB, its address is compared to each of
the enabled windows. If there is a hit and it passes the security checks it is
advances to the target port.

The IOB node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-iob"
	- reg: the base address of the IOB unit
	- max-win: number of the max mbus windows
	- windows: entry that include the configuration of the windows
	  every window should have 3 parameters:
	  - base address of the window
	  - size of the window
	  - target-id of the window

Target ID options:
	- 0x0 = Internal configuration space
	- 0x1 = IHB0
	- 0x2 = PEX1_X1
	- 0x3 = PEX2_X1
	- 0x4 = PEX0_X4
	- 0x5 = NAND flash
	- 0x6 = RUNIT (NOR/SPI/BootRoom)
	- 0x7 = IHB1

Example:
	map-iob {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-iob";
		reg = <0x190000 0x50>;
		max-win = <24>;
		windows = <0xf8000000 0x1000000 0x2 /* PEX1_X1 window */
				0xf9000000 0x1000000 0x5 /* NAND window */>;
	};
