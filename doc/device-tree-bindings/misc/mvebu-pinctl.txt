Marvell pinctl bindings
=======================

The mvebu-pinctl driver enables changing the function
of multi purpose pins and controlling GPIOs. each dt
entry describes a single pinctl bank. an SOC may
have several pinctl banks.

The mvebu-pinctl requires the following proprties:
	- compatible
	  	should be "marvell, mvebu-pinctl"
	- bank-name
	  	a unique name identifying the bank
	- reg
		description of the mpp register base and size
	- pin-count
	  	the amount of pins controlled by this bank
	- max-func
		the maximum function number supported by this bank
	- pin-func
		an array specifying the function per pin


Example of a pinctl bank node:
	pinctl@18000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-pinctl";
		bank-name ="armada-380";
		reg = <0x18000 0x24>;
		pin-count = <64>;
		max-func = <7>;
		pin-func = < 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
			     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 6
			     6 2 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2
			     2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2
			     2 2 0 2 4 0 0 4 5 5
			     5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5
			     0 0 0 0>;
	};
