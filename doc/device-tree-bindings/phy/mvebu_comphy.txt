Marvell COMPHY SerDes lane bindings
=====================================

The COMPHY node includes a description of the COMPHY SerDes lane configuration.
The COMPHY driver initializes the MUX of the SerDes lanes, and powers up the SerDes
by dependencies on the FDT blob configurations

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible:
		The compatible should include "marvell,mvebu-comphy"
		and the COMPHY per chip compatible:
		"marvell,comphy-armada38x" for Armada-38x.
		The COMPHY per chip used to set which MUX configuration to use, and COMPHY power-up revision.
	- reg-comphy: Base address and size of the COMPHY units.
	- reg-hpipe3: Base address and size of the hpipe3 units.
	- max-lanes: Maximum number of comphy lanes.
	- mux-bitcount: Number of bits that are allocated for every MUX in the COMPHY-selector register.
Board specific:
	- phy: Entry that include the configuration of the phy.
	  Every phy should have the below parameters:
	  - phy-type: PHY type (SGMII0/SATA1/PEX2...), the posible modes under include/dt-bindings/comphy/comphy_data.h
	Optional properties:
	  - phy-speed: PHY speed (1G/1.5G...), the posible speeds under include/dt-bindings/comphy/comphy_data.h
	  - phy-invert: Polarity invert (PHY_POLARITY_TXD_INVERT/PHY_POLARITY_RXD_INVERT), the
	  	posible bits under include/dt-bindings/comphy/comphy_data.h
	  - clk-src: Set the clock source of PCIe, if configured to PCIe clock output
		This relevant for SerDes lane 5 only (by default, lane 4 is the clock source)
		for Armada-7040 boards.

Example:
	comphy {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-comphy", "marvell,comphy-armada38x";
		mux-bitcount = <4>;
		max-comphy = <6>;
		reg-comphy = <0x18300 0x100>;
		reg-hpipe3 = <0xa0000 0x800>;
		phy0 {
			phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_SATA0>;
		};
		phy1 {
			phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_PEX0>;
		};
		phy2 {
			phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_SGMII0>;
			phy-speed = <PHY_SPEED_3_125G>;
		};
	};
