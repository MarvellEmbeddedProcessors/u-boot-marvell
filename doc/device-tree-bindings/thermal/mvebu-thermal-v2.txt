Marvell Thermal Sensor V2 bindings
=====================================

The thermal node v2 include description about the Thermal Sensor External Unit.
The thernal sensor v2 is an on chip temprature sensor that read the temprature of
every core and return the average or the maximum between them.

The thermal node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,thermal-sensor-v2"
	- reg: the base address of thermal unit
	- gain, offset: parameters of the temperature equation
		the equation:
		T(in celsius) = T(read value) * gain + offset
	Note: in Tsen SPEC the default value of gain equal to 0.425
		In the u-boot we can't calculate real number (no floating point)
		need to set the gain and offset by multiply them by 1000
		this will help for calculate the equation, see example below.

Example of equation:
T(in celsius) = T(read value) * 0.425 + 153.4
Change to:
T(in celsius) = (T(read value) * 425 + 153400) / 1000

Example:
	thermal: thermal@ {
		compatible = "marvell,thermal-sensor-v2";
		reg = <0x7F0084 0x12>;
		gain = <425>;
		offset = <153400>;
		divisor = <1000>;
		status = "okay";
	};
