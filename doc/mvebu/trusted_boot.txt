Trusted Boot (Secure Mode)
==========================

The trusted boot setup requires configuration of several components:
- eFuse module - Allows burning boot device, authentication key digest, encryption key, etc.
- boot image format - Provides the trusted boot information to BootROM.

1. eFuses
=========
The eFuse command module and driver provides RW access to SoC eFuses through the "efuse" command.
In order to enable this SW component, the following configuration entry should be set:

	CONFIG_MVEBU_EFUSE_SUPPORT=y

The same parameter can be selected using "make menuconfig":

	-> Device Drivers
		-> eFuse support
			-> eFuse support

The above configuration enables the eFuse driver and eFuse command module.
Refer to SoC and BootROM manuals for details about supported eFuses
and their role in the trusted boot flow.
Since the eFuse command module and driver are only used for simplified access
to eFuse HW values, the presence of these components in the final trusted boot image
is not required.

A8K platforms
-------------
The AES-256 key is visible only during the efuse burn session. It will be hidden after
reset and accessible only on early boot stages by the internal BootROM procedures.
Trying to read efuse values of AES-256 key will return zeros.
Note that if the JTAG is permanently enabled in A8K efuse, the AES-256 key
becomes hidden for everyone, including the BootROM. Therefore when JTAG is enabled permanently
by eFuse, the boot image should not be encrypted, since BootROM decryption will always
fail unless zero-key was used for image encryption.

2. Boot image format
====================
The boot image should be properly formatted for the trusted boot mode, so the BootROM extracts
the required information from the image headers and uses it for authentication against eFuse
values and digital signatures and for image decryption.
Various platforms use different BootROMs and boot image formats. For specific details refer
to the SoC functional specification, BootROM manual and to the section related to a selected
platform below.
Refer to ATF build documentation for enabling secure image output.

A8K platforms
-------------
Refer to A8K functional specification for details about trusted boot image components.
The secure image configuration is defined by a file sec_img_xx.cfg located in ATF folder
tools/doimage/secure. The xx in the configuration file name is either 7K or 8K for targeting
Armada-80x0 or Aramda-70x0 platform setup accordingly.
The configuration file has a standard INI file format and defines the following options:

- kak_key_file - The string containing path to the Keys Authentication Key file in PEM format.
		This parameter is mandatory.

- csk_key_file	- Array of string containing paths to Code Signing Key files in PEM format.
		This array has to include at least a single key used for signing the boot image and
		prolog. The key index is defined by the file location in this array.
		Empty key paths should be coded as "*" strings to make the entire array size of 16
                strings. This parameter is mandatory.

- csk_key_index - The integer value in range of 0 to 15 defining the CSK file from the above array
		to be used for creating image and prolog signatures.
		This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to 0.

- aes_key_file	- The string containing the path to the AES-256 symmetric key file in ASCII text
		format.
 		The boot image will be encrypted if this parameter is included in the configuration
		or left unencrypted if the parameter is omitted.
		This parameter is optional.

- efuse_disable - Boolean parameter defining whether to disable access to efuses in secure boot
		mode or not.
		Can be either "true" or "false". The efuse access policy is enforced by the BootROM.
		This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to "true".

- jtag		- Parameters defining the JTAG behavior in trusted boot mode.
		There are two parameters enclosed in curly brackets - "enable" and "delay".
		The "jtag.enable" boolean parameter allows to enable the JTAG support in trusted
		boot mode (valid values "true" and "false").
		The second parameter - "jtag.delay" (integer) defines delay in milliseconds
		the BootROM waits before enabling the JTAG connection in the HW.
		These parameters are optional and if omitted default to "false" and 0 respectfully.

- box_id	- 4 byte hexadecimal number to be used as box ID. This value will be part of the
		secure extension in the trusted boot image and should match the value burned in the
		appropriate efuse field.
		This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to 0.

- flash_id	- 4 byte hexadecimal number to be used as the flash ID. This value will be part of
		the secure extension in trusted boot image and should match the value burned in the
		appropriate efuse field.
		This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to 0.

- control	- Array of hexadecimal addresses to be set on each CP connected to an AP in trusted
		mode.
		It is required to add two addresses for each connected CP.
		The first address points to the CP SecureBootControl register and the second address
		points to the CP EfuseBurnControl register.
		Refer to your SoC documentation for details. For instance, Armada-7040 SoC
		has a single CP connected to AP, so this array has to list 2 register addresses.
		The Armada-8040 has two CPS connected to AP, so this array has to include 4
		register addresses.
		This parameter is optional.

3. Work order - target preparation
==================================
After the trusted boot mode is selected by the SoC eFuse, the BootROM enforces security checks upon
boot image load. Therefore a right work order is essential for target preparation and preventing
the system from self-locking.

A8K platforms
-------------
1. Build an image for trusted boot mode using the configuration file described above and any
   additional settings required by ATF. The image encryption option should not be used in this build,
   since the resulting image should be compatible with non-trusted systems.
2. Burn the image on the target board and boot it. The secure header will be bypassed in non-trusted
   boot mode and the system will start as usual.
3. Burn all required efuses using "efuse write" commands. The trusted boot enable efuse should be
   burned last since any further modifications to the SoC efuses will not be possible afterwards.
4. Verify the efuse values using "efuse dump" and/or "efuse raw" commands.
5. Restart the system and ensure the secure boot authentication stage has been passed.
6. If the image encryption option is required, build a new image with image encryption enabled and
   burn it to the system boot device using the regular "bubt" command.

A3700 platforms
---------------
1. Create an UNTRUSTED boot image with eFuse command module support (as stated in the "eFuses"
   chapter above) and burn it on the target flash device using the regular "bubt" command.
2. Create a TRUSTED boot image (as stated in "Boot image format" chapter above) and save it
   for later use.
   When the trusted boot image is created, the TBB tool saves the Key Authentication Key digest in
   the file named OtpHash.txt.
   This digest value will be used for eFuse programming so save this file.
   The OtpHash.txt file lists the KAK digest in groups of 4-bytes values, organized in the following
   order:
       LSB ... ... ... MSB
   These values should be converted to a single 32-bytes value for eFuse burning:
       MSB ... ... ... LSB.
   For instance, the following OTP hash:

	   0x1887C298
	   0x59C9AFD9
	   0x6E814E34
	   0x25CD518B
	   0x3CDB7EED
	   0x33CC58B1
	   0x2C69997A
	   0xC27B7242

   Will be used in the following form in eFuse KAK digest write command:
       C27B72422C69997A33CC58B13CDB7EED25CD518B6E814E3459C9AFD91887C298
3. Boot the target board with the UNTRUSTED boot image.
4. Using the "efuse" command, program eFuse values as required, but do not reset the target board yet.
5. Burn the TRUSTED boot image using regular "bubt" command.
6. Reset the board and verify that the trusted boot mode works.
