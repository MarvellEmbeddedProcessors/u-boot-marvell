Trusted (secure mode) Boot
###########################

The trusted boot setup requires configuration of several components:
- eFuse module - Allows burning boot device, authentication key digest, encryption key, etc.
- boot image format - Provides the trusted boot information to BootROM.

=========
1. eFuses
=========
The eFuse command module and driver provides RW access to SoC eFuses through the "efuse" command.
In order to enable this SW component, the following configuration entry should be set:
	CONFIG_MVEBU_EFUSE_SUPPORT=y
The same parameter can be selected using "make menuconfig":
-> Device Drivers
	-> eFuse support
		-> eFuse support
The above configuration enables the eFuse driver and eFuse command module.
Please refer to SoC and BootROM manuals for details about supported eFuses
and their role in the trusted boot flow.
Since the eFuse command module and driver are only used for simplified access
to eFuse HW values, the presence of these components in the final trusted boot image
is not required.

A3700 platforms
///////////////

Please note that on the A3700 platform the eFuses are not directly accessible by the application CPU.
Therefore an appropriate WTMI module that provides the eFuse RW through the mailbox interface
is required.
The example WTMI code is located inside the "tools/wtp/wtmi" folder and allows RW access to all
secure eFuses of A3700 SoC. Such full access is good for initial debugging, but for security
reasons should block read access at least to the image encryption key on a real systems.

====================
2. Boot image format
====================
The boot image should be properly formatted for the trusted boot mode, so the BootROM extracts
the required information from the image headers and uses it for authentication against eFuse
values and digital signatures and for image decryption.
Various platforms use different BootROMs and boot image formats. For a specific details please refer
to the SoC functional specification, BootROM manual and to the section related to a selected platform below.
In order to create boot image for the trusted boot mode, the following configuration parameter
should be set:
	CONFIG_MVEBU_SECURE_BOOT=y
The same parameter can be selected using "make menuconfig":
-> Support MVEBU devices
	-> Marvell Platform
		-> Trusted Boot Image format

TIM/NTIM descriptors
--------------------
The A3700 image format is defined by a text file called TIM/TIMN descriptor.
This descriptor defines boot image components, their locations on the boot device and in system memory,
type of authentication (digital signature) to be used by BootROM in trusted boot mode and type
of encryption algorithm in case the image should be encrypted.
All details regarding the TIM/TIMN descriptor format are provided in the A3700 BootROM manual.
The TIM/TIMN descriptor is created from multiple components located in the tools/wtp folders.
The components for trusted boot mode are located in the "trusted" sub-folder and for non-trusted
boot mode in the "untrusted" sub-folder.
The final descriptors to be used with the TIM tool are crested using the Bash script "buildtim.sh" located
in the "scripts" directory.
The "keys" sub-folder contains test keys generated for building the sample trusted boot image.
These keys are used for the creation of authentication keys TIM/TIMN components located in the "trusted" folder.
The method used for new keys generation is described in the WTPTP tools manual and is out of scope of
this document.
When TIM/TIMN descriptors are processed by the TBB tool, a binary versions of TIM/TIMN headers are
created. A special script "tim2img.pl", located in "scripts" folder is used for parsing the TIM/TIMN
descriptors and building a single boot image from all binaries stated there suitable for usage with
u-boot "bubt" command.

Image Encryption
----------------
Since the WTPTP tools do not support image encryption, external tools should be used for
encrypting image components. Please refer to the main Makefile for an example of image encryption
using OpenSSL tools ("encrypt" recipe).
The OpenSSL library is usually installed by default on a basic Linux system.
In case the installation is missing, the following command will install it on the Ubuntu/Debian machine:
# apt-get install openssl

==================================
3. Work order - target preparation
==================================
After the trusted boot mode is selected by SoC eFuse, the BootROM enforces security checks upon
boot image load. Therefore a right work order is essential for target preparation and preventing
the system from self-locking.

1. Create an UNTRUSTED boot image with eFuse command module support (as stated in "eFuses" chapter above)
   and burn it on target flash device using the regular "bubt" command.
2. Create a TRUSTED boot image (as stated in "Boot image format" chapter above) and save it for later use.
   When the trusted boot image is created, the the TBB tool saves the Key Authentication Key digest in file
   named OtpHash.txt. This digest value will be used for eFuse programming so save this file.
   The OtpHash.txt file lists the KAK digest in groups of 4-bytes values, organized in the following
   order:
       LSB
       ...
       ...
       MSB
   These values should be converted to a single 32-bytes value for eFuse burning:
       MSB ... ... ... LSB.
   For instance, the following OTP hash:
       0x1887C298
       0x59C9AFD9
       0x6E814E34
       0x25CD518B
       0x3CDB7EED
       0x33CC58B1
       0x2C69997A
       0xC27B7242
   Will be used in the following form in eFuse KAK digest write command:
       C27B72422C69997A33CC58B13CDB7EED25CD518B6E814E3459C9AFD91887C298
3. Boot the target board with the UNTRUSTED boot image.
4. Using the "efuse" command, program eFuse values as required, but do not reset the target board yet.
5. Burn the TRUSTED boot image using regular "bubt" command.
6. Reset the board and verify that the trusted boot mode works.
